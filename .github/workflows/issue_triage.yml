            Hey @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}! We really appreciate you taking the time to
            report an issue. The collaborators on this project attempt to help as many people as
            possible, but we're a limited number of volunteers, so it's possible this won't be
            addressed swiftly.


            If you need any help, you can ask in our [GitHub
            Discussions](https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app/discussions)."
