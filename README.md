One App is a fresh take on web application development. It consists of a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
server that serves up a single page app built using [React] components and
makes use of [Holocron](https://github.com/americanexpress/holocron) to allow for code splitting
via independently developed, tested, and deployed **Holocron Modules**.

Our goal is to provide a web application framework for building fast, scalable, secure, and modular
experiences. Leave the tooling to us and focus on what matters - delivering performant, maintainable experiences to your users.

> While American Express has been using One App in production since 2016, this open source iteration
> of the framework is in a soft launch state. There will be a full documentation site forthcoming.

## ü§π‚Äç Usage

### Quick Start

#### Build a Module with [generator-one-app-module](https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app-cli/tree/master/packages/generator-one-app-module)

The easiest way to do this is via [`npx`](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner) (comes with `npm` versions 5.2.0 and above). Run the following command in the directory you want your module to live:

```bash
export NODE_ENV=development
npx -p yo -p @americanexpress/generator-one-app-module -- yo @americanexpress/one-app-module
```

This will use the [One App Module Generator](https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app-cli/tree/master/packages/generator-one-app-module) to generate a basic One App module.

#### Clone and Install One App

```bash
export NODE_ENV=development
git clone https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app.git
cd one-app
npm ci --no-optional
```

#### Serve your Module to One App

At the root of your `one-app` repo, run:

```bash
npm run serve-module <local-path-to-generated-module>
# e.g. npm run serve-module ../my-first-module
```

The `serve-module` command generates a `static` folder in the `one-app` root directory, containing a `module-map.json` and a `modules` folder with your bundled module code:
```
one-app/static
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module-map.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-module
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.0.0
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-module.browser.js
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-module.browser.js.map
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-module.legacy.browser.js
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-module.legacy.browser.js.map
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-module.node.js
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-module.node.js.map
```

Paired with the built-in [one-app-dev-cdn](https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app-dev-cdn) library, you're able to utilize the [Holocron Module Map](./docs/api/server/Module-Map-Schema.md) while running your entire One App instance locally. No need to deploy and fetch remote assets from a CDN at this step.

#### Declare the module as your Root Module and start One App:

Start up One App and declare your new module as the [Root Module](#the-root-module):

```bash
npm start -- --root-module-name=<module-name>
# e.g. npm start -- --root-module-name=my-first-module
```

This starts One App and makes it available at http://localhost:3000/ where you can see it in action!

Open another terminal window, run `npm run watch:build` in your module's directory and make some edits to the module. One App will pick up these changes and update the module bundles accordingly. When you reload your browser window, One App will be displaying your updated module.

### The Root Module

The root module serves as the entry point for one-app to load an application.

```
          | ------ your application ------- |
* one-app -> root-module -> [other modules] |
          | ------------------------------- |
```

It is possible for your application to consist of only the root module, however most application will want to take advantage of code splitting using [Holocron](https://github.com/americanexpress/holocron) and have the root module load other modules. More on this in the [Routing](./docs/api/modules/Routing.md) section in the API docs.

For a module to act as the root module the only requirements are:

- Returns a React component bundled with [one-app-bundler](https://github.com/americanexpress/one-app-cli/tree/master/packages/one-app-bundler).
- Provides a valid [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) though the [appConfig](./docs/api/modules/App-Configuration.md) static.
